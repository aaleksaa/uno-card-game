# Description
This project was completed for the college "Computer networks" course. It is a multiplayer Uno game implemented with Java sockets.
When each client connects to the server, they must provide a username, which must be unique. After a successful connection, the client 
is shown the current lobbies. Lobby can be private or public; clients can join a public lobby without an invite, while a private lobby 
requires an invite. A client can also create their own lobby, in that case they become admin of that lobby. The game can start when there 
are at least two players in the lobby and the players have marked themselves as ready. In the game, client can see whose turn it is, how many 
cards each player has in their hand, the current card, and the cards in their own hand. The game continues until only one player remains with cards.
After the game ends, the client return to the lobby selection screen and their lobby is removed.
